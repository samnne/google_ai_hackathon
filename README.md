# Google AI — Roadmap App - uPath

**Concise overview:**

- Purpose: Guides users step-by-step through a learning path. Each step is a widget with a description and resources. Steps are generated via the Prompt API (one step per widget) rather than showing all steps at once.
- Database: Firebase (Firestore + Firebase Admin on server).

**Tech stack:**

- FIREBASE (client SDK + Admin on server)
- REACT (frontend)
- VITE (build/dev tool)
- EXPRESS (server)
- TAILWIND CSS
- PROMPT API (for generating each learning step)

Versions

- React: 18.x
- Vite: 5.x

Quick setup (Windows)

1. Clone / open repo.
2. Server:

   ```powershell
   cd server
   npm install
   # start dev (if package.json defines a dev script)
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Client**:

   ```powershell
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the client URL shown by Vite.

**Environment notes**

- Client env vars must use the Vite prefix: VITE\_\*. Example in `client/.env`:

  ```
  VITE_APP_API_URL=...
  ```

  Access in code via `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`.

**Security**

- Uses Firebase Auth as the main authenticated

How it works

- Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind) renders roadmap widgets based on a node graph stored in Firestore.
- Each widget is a node with resources and a goal.
- New next-step nodes are generated by calling the Prompt API; results are stored in Firestore via the Express server.
- Server uses Firebase Admin SDK for authenticated DB ops.
