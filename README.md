# Google AI — Roadmap App - uPath

Concise overview:

- Purpose: Guides users step-by-step through a learning path. Each step is a widget with a description and resources. Steps are generated via the Prompt API (one step per widget) rather than showing all steps at once.
- Database: Firebase (Firestore + Firebase Admin on server).


Tech stack:

- FIREBASE (client SDK + Admin on server)
- REACT (frontend)
- VITE (build/dev tool)
- EXPRESS (server)
- TAILWIND CSS
- PROMPT API (for generating each learning step)

Versions

- React: 18.x (project is built on React 18 — verify exact version with `cat client/package.json` or `npm --prefix client list react`)
- Vite: 5.x (verify exact version with `cat client/package.json` or `npm --prefix client list vite`)
  (Replace above with the exact values from your package.json if needed.)

Quick setup (Windows)

1. Clone / open repo.
2. Server:
   ```powershell
   cd server
   npm install
   # start dev (if package.json defines a dev script)
   npm run dev
   # or
   node server.js
   ```
3. Client:
   ```powershell
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the client URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Environment notes

- Client env vars must use the Vite prefix: VITE\_\*. Example in `client/.env`:
  ```
  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
  ```
  Access in code via `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`.
- Server env in `server/.env` for Firebase Admin and other secrets (do not commit).
- Firebase Admin uses a service account JSON (kept in server config). Keep it private.

Security

- Frontend sends raw passwords only over HTTPS to the backend; the server must hash (bcrypt/argon2) before storing.
- Do not initialize Firebase Analytics on the server side (analytics is browser-only).

How it works (brief)

- Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind) renders roadmap widgets based on a node graph stored in Firestore.
- Each widget is a node with resources and a goal.
- New next-step nodes are generated by calling the Prompt API; results are stored in Firestore via the Express server.
- Server uses Firebase Admin SDK for authenticated DB ops.
